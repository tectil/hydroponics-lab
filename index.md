## Tectil Hydroponics Lab

Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture which involves growing plants without soil. Hydroponic cultures need less water and allow a high degree of automation. Hydroponics have the potential to grow plants that are even healthier than conventionally grown organic plants, if water used is filtered and crops are protected from environmental pollution. If grown decentralized close to the customer, plants can be harvested nearly just in time, keeping valuable nutrients.

We believe, healthy, hyper fresh, organic, maintenance free and affordable nutrition is a matter of technics. This project aims to collect and share information around our main theses.
